### Exercises 14.3-1
y.max = x.max
x.max = max(x.int.high, x.left.max, x.right.max)

### Exercises 14.3-2
```
INTERVAL-SEARCH(T, i)
1 x = T.root
2 while x != T.nil and (i.int.high <= x.int.low or x.int.high <= i.int.low)
3     if x.left != T.nil and x.left.max > i.low
4         x = x.left
5     else x = x.right
6 return x
```

### Exercises 14.3-6
Based on Exercise 14.2-1, we can maintain SUCCESSOR in O(1) time,   
each time after updating the SUCCESSOR,   
we can update x.gap  to x.successor.key - x.key.   
And based on Exercise 14.2-1 we can also maintain the minimum gap of the subtree in O(1) time.
