### Exercises 13.3-4
In order to set T.nil.color to RED, z.p must be the root; 
and if z.p is the root, then z.p is black, the loop terminates. 

### Exercises 13.3-5
In case 1, z and z.p.p are RED, if the loop terminates, then z could not be the root, thus z is RED after the fix up.

In case 2, z and z.p are RED, and after the rotation z.p could not be the root, thus z.p is RED after the fix up.

In case 3, z is RED and z could not be the root, thus z is RED after the fix up.

Therefore, there is always at least one red node.

### Exercises 13.3-6
Use stack to record the path to the inserted node, then parent is the top element in the stack.

In case 1, we pop z.p and z.p.p.

In case 2, we pop z.p and z.p.p, then push z.p.p and z.

In case 3, we pop z.p, z.p.p and z.p.p.p, then push z.p.
