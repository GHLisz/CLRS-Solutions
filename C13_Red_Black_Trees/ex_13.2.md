Only the root cannot be rotated.

### Exercises 13.2-3
a:+1; b:0; c:-1

### Exercises 13.2-4
For each left leaf, we perform right rotation until there is no left leaf. We need at most n-1 right rotations to transform the tree into a right-going chain.

Since we can transform every tree into a right-going chain, and the operation is invertible, therefore we can transform one tree into the right-going chain and use the inverse operation to construct the other tree.
